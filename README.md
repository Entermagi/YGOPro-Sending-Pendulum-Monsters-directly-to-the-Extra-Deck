For the Pendulum effect of Abyssive Angler
When an "Abyssive" monster(s) is Special Summoned, you can place 1 "Abyssive" Pendulum Monster from your hand, Deck or Graveyard face-up into your Extra Deck. You can only activate this effect of "Abyssive Angler" once per turn.
Using Notepad++
I tried various from cards that return Extra Deck Monsters to the ED but in the code do that via SendtoDeck which, because of the mechanics of those monsters, works. But Pendulum Monsters can be in the Main Deck too and the same principle won't for them. I left it just so you know what I want help with.
