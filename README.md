For the Pendulum effect of Abyssive Angler

When an "Abyssive" monster(s) is Special Summoned, you can place 1 "Abyssive" Pendulum Monster from your hand, Deck or Graveyard face-up into your Extra Deck. You can only activate this effect of "Abyssive Angler" once per turn.

Using Notepad++

I tried various codes from cards that return Extra Deck Monsters ( Spiritual Beasts, Fusion Substitute, Limitover Drive, etc. ) to the ED but in the code they do so with SendtoDeck( or Hand ) which, because of the mechanics of those monsters, works. But Pendulum Monsters can be in the Main Deck too, meaning the same principle won't work for them.

I left it at MovetoExtraDeck just so you know what and where I need help.
